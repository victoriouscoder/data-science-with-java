Data science is an incredibly interesting field - not to mention lucrative, with “data scientist” regularly at the top of lists bearing titles like “hottest jobs of 2020”. The ability to use data science in the real world has profound implications for nearly every industry, and it is for this reason that a huge number of companies are looking for programmers who know how to do data science - and conversely, data scientists who know how to program. That’s where Java comes in. As you’ll see in this course, Java for Data Science provides a match made in heaven. Java’s power, flexibility, and popularity make it an incredible tool for the budding data scientist.
What you'll learn-and how you can apply it

    Learn what data science is, how it can be used, and the basic data-science process
    Learn the basics of working with and manipulating data in Java
    Learn how to visualize data and some libraries that can help us do so
    Learn the most important data-science algorithms for turning data into information. This will cover things like Nearest-neighbor, Bayes, Linear Regression, Decision trees, and more

This training course is for you because...

    You’re a Java developer who wants to advance your career by breaking into the data-science field
    You’re a data scientist who wants to see how to use Java in the field
    You’re neither a data-scientist nor a programmer and want to dive head-first into both

Prerequisites

    Java: Knowledge of basic Java syntax and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
    Familiarity with mathematical concepts: Some experience with basic algebra.
